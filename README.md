# RemitWise Frontend

Frontend application for the RemitWise remittance and financial planning platform.

## Overview

This is a Next.js-based frontend skeleton that provides the UI structure for all RemitWise features. The application is built with:

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** - Icon library

## Features (Placeholders)

The frontend includes placeholder pages and components for:

1. **Dashboard** - Overview of remittances, savings, bills, and insurance
2. **Send Money** - Remittance sending interface with automatic split preview
3. **Smart Money Split** - Configuration for automatic allocation
4. **Savings Goals** - Goal-based savings tracking and management
5. **Bill Payments** - Bill tracking, scheduling, and payment
6. **Micro-Insurance** - Policy management and premium payments
7. **Family Wallets** - Family member management with roles and spending limits

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Integration Requirements

### Stellar SDK Integration

1. **Wallet Connection**
   - Integrate Freighter wallet or similar
   - Connect to Stellar network (testnet/mainnet)
   - Handle account authentication

2. **Smart Contract Integration**
   - Connect to deployed Soroban contracts
   - Implement contract function calls
   - Handle transaction signing and submission

3. **Anchor Platform Integration**
   - Integrate with anchor platform APIs for fiat on/off-ramps
   - Handle deposit/withdrawal flows
   - Process exchange rate quotes

4. **Transaction Tracking**
   - Display on-chain transaction history
   - Show transaction status and confirmations
   - Implement real-time updates

### Key Integration Points

- **Send Money Page**: Connect to Stellar SDK for transaction creation and signing
- **Split Configuration**: Call `remittance_split` contract to initialize/update split
- **Savings Goals**: Integrate with `savings_goals` contract for goal management
- **Bills**: Connect to `bill_payments` contract for bill tracking
- **Insurance**: Integrate with `insurance` contract for policy management
- **Family Wallets**: Connect to `family_wallet` contract for member management

## Backend / API

### Overview

This Next.js application uses API routes to handle backend functionality. API routes are located in the `app/api/` directory and follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions.

**Key API Routes:**
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints (wallet connect, nonce generation, signature verification)
- `/api/transactions/*` - Transaction history and status
- `/api/contracts/*` - Soroban smart contract interactions
- `/api/health` - Health check endpoint

All API routes are serverless functions deployed alongside the frontend.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Stellar Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet  # or 'mainnet'
NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org

# Contract IDs (deployed Soroban contracts)
NEXT_PUBLIC_REMITTANCE_SPLIT_CONTRACT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SAVINGS_GOALS_CONTRACT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BILL_PAYMENTS_CONTRACT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_INSURANCE_CONTRACT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FAMILY_WALLET_CONTRACT_ID=

# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here  # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
SESSION_COOKIE_NAME=remitwise-session
SESSION_MAX_AGE=86400  # 24 hours in seconds

# API Configuration
API_RATE_LIMIT=100  # requests per minute
API_TIMEOUT=30000  # milliseconds

# Optional: Anchor Platform
ANCHOR_PLATFORM_URL=
ANCHOR_PLATFORM_API_KEY=
```

See `.env.example` for a complete list of configuration options.

### Running the Backend

The backend API routes run automatically with the Next.js development server:

```bash
# Development mode (with hot reload)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000/api/*`

### Authentication Flow

RemitWise uses wallet-based authentication with the following flow:

1. **Wallet Connect**: User connects their Stellar wallet (Freighter, Albedo, etc.)
   - Frontend detects wallet extension
   - User authorizes connection
   - Public key is retrieved

2. **Nonce Generation**: 
   - Client requests nonce from `/api/auth/nonce`
   - Server generates unique nonce and stores temporarily
   - Nonce returned to client

3. **Signature Verification**:
   - Client signs nonce with wallet private key
   - Signed message sent to `/api/auth/verify`
   - Server verifies signature matches public key
   - If valid, session token is created

4. **Session Management**:
   - JWT token stored in HTTP-only cookie
   - Token includes user's public key and expiration
   - Subsequent requests include token for authentication
   - Token validated on protected API routes

**Protected Routes**: All `/api/transactions/*`, `/api/contracts/*` endpoints require valid session.

## Design Notes

- All forms are currently disabled (placeholders)
- UI uses a blue/indigo color scheme
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Components are structured for easy integration

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time transaction updates
- Push notifications for bill reminders
- Charts and graphs for financial insights
- Multi-language support
- Dark mode
- Mobile app (React Native)
